Born in Japan but raised in the southern Appalachian Mountains, I never left Nashville once I came to this town for college.

A huge fan of Paul Simon, my 10-year-old cat is named Simon, and his 1-year-old brother (in that they're of the same species) is Sunny (name inspired by 'The Obvious Child').  Both were adopted from Nashville Humane Association.  Oh, I also have a husband, but he is not from the humane society.
