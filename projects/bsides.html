<h2>BSides Nashville: Work-in-Progress</h2>
<h4>Team Members: Ayumi Bennett, Margaret Clinard</h4>
  <img src= "/images/bsidesnash.png">
<p>Security Bsides is a grassroots, DIY, open security conference framework that utilizes a combination of two event styles: structured anchor events and grass-roots geocentric events.  BSides Nashville uses the umbrella organization's philosophy and leadership as the basis to run a yearly conference that is always sold out.</p>
<p>I approached the head of the organization in the spring to see if they would like to have a website redesign given that they will be transitioning as a nonprofit organization this year and could use a web framework that might suit their type of content.</p>
